<p>Skills determine the outcome of almost every action your character takes in Angrea. Chopping wood? That's a skill check. Cooking dinner? Skill check. Flirting with an attractive innkeeper? Skill check. Whenever you try to do a task where there is a chance of failure, the GM will determine what skill applies, and what attributes are available to use with it. Picking a lock? That will usually be Mechanical Engineering + Agility. Haggling with a merchant? Now things get interesting.</p>
<p>Are you buying a magical blade, perhaps you can leverage your knowledge of arcane artifacts by making an Arcane Engineering + Reason check. Are you a master of the rhetorical arts? Maybe you're better off combining Language + Reason, or perhaps Psychology + Perception. Maybe you just like to bash in the heads of people who don't agree with you, in that case a Psychology + Strength check may be in order. Whatever combination you and the GM arrive at, adding your attribute and skill will determine the dice pool you have available to attempt your task.</p>
<p>When determining a dice pool while applying a specialization, add the general skill die to the specialization die. For example, when Susan was creating Grimble, e decided to max out Grimble's Mechanical Engineering skill at 2D. E did this by first assigning 1D to the general skill, then splitting a second die into three specialization die. E put 2D in Mechanical Engineering: Firearms, and 1D into Mechanical Engineering: Steam Engines. The 3D in specializations and 1D in the general skill max out eir starting skill level in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p>Later, Grimble's pistol jams. The GM tells Sarah to roll Mechanical Engineering: Firearms. E takes Grimble's 2D in the Firearms specialization and adds it to eir 1D in the general Mechanical Engineering Skill, resulting in a total of 3D for eir skill dice pool. E could normally now choose whether to use eir Perception or Reason to try to fix the pistol, but the GM rules that e doesn't have the time to reason it out, so e must rely on eir ability to quickly spot details using Perception to find the problem. This works for Sarah, because Grimble's Perception is better than eir Reason anyway. E adds 4D to the 3D skill dice pool. E now has a 7D dice pool for Grimble to attempt quickly repairing eir pistol.</p>
<p>Sarah rolls 7D. E manages to get two 5s and one 6. The GM had decided e needed two successes to repair the pistol, and tells Sarah that Grimble manages to repair the jam, but e's not sure for how long. After e's out of combat, Sarah may wish to have Grimble sit down and use Reason to more thoroughly check eir pistol to reduce the chance of jamming in the future.</p>
<h1>Combat Skills</h1>
<p>This family of skills covers everything from brawling in a tavern, to the elegant dance of formal fencing. Whether you prefer to deal with your opponents up-close and brutal, or safely at a distance, these are the skills you'll need to defend your life when outside the protection of civilization. You can't specialize in combat skills, but you can choose styles, which can give bonuses to your combat in specific situations. For each die placed in a combat skill you may choose to increase the bonus in any one style, as long as training in that style is available to you. The styles listed below are the most popular in the Isles, but if they don't meet the vision you have for your character, work with your GM to invent some that do.</p>
<h2>Unarmed Combat</h2>
<p>Unarmed Combat covers everything from boxing to the graceful martial arts of the elves. You'll use this skill whenever you make an attack without a weapon, but also whenever you attempt to block an attack as well. Angrea has a rich history of martial arts, which many practice not only for combat, but to teach self-discipline and other cultural values. It's favored by humans, elves, and halflings.</p>
<h3>Kickboxing</h3>
<p>The Neuranian form of the kickboxing art originated in Solanth. It's brutal and direct, and its practitioners commonly train for strength over agility. For each time you increase the kickboxing bonus, your character's strikes gain an automatic point of damage on any successful attacks (when combining strength+unarmed combat).</p>
<h3>Vidalos</h3>
<p>Elven for "as the tides", Vidalos is a martial art originating from their ancient ocean home. Training involves slow graceful movements as one would use underwater. Accuracy is favored over raw power. For each time you increase the Vidalos bonus, agility block and attack are treated as if unarmed combat had an additional 1D.</p>
<h3>Mun Gra</h3>
<p>Dwarven for "mountain hold", Mun Gra focuses on grappling with your opponents. Composed of mostly holds and throws, Mun Gra is especially effective for the shorter statured dwarves. Many halflings practice what they consider a branch of Mun Gra, that mostly involves climbing an opponent's back and placing em in a sleeper hold until e's unconscious. For each time you increase the Mun Gra bonus, unarmed combat is treated as having an additional 1D when attempting to grapple or throw an opponent.</p>
<h2>Bladed Weapons</h2>
<p>Bladed Weapons covers swords, knives, axes, and polearms. Anything with an edge, this is the skill in which to train. It covers attacking and parrying. The Neuranian Empire is known mostly for its sword arts, which span everything from Elven longsword, to Sea Dwarf cutlass.</p>
<h3>Velaos</h3>
<p>Elven for "as a reef", Velaos is the art of the Elven longsword. Evolving from the graceful flow of Vidalos, Velaos is the art that most closely resembles our world's fencing. Utilizing the straight and narrow blade of the Elven longsword, it is both elegant and deadly. For every increase in Velaos, agility parry gains 1D, and for each even increase, bladed weapons+agility gets an automatic point of damage on a successful attack.</p>
<h3>Quicksilver</h3>
<p>Quicksilver is a duel dagger technique popular among Houses Aeth and Satariel. Its origin is disputed. The prominent Koranthian family Theros claim they originated the art on their home isle, while the Halflings say they are the inventors, and charge Theros with stealing the technique. Neither side is exactly known for its honesty, so among those who have reason to care, a sometimes bitter divide has developed. When you're trained in the quick and lethal art of Quicksilver, such disputes are often as bloody as they are frighteningly quiet. For each increase in quicksilver, sneak attacks with daggers get 2 automatic points of damage on a successful attack. For every third increase, masters of Quicksilver gain an additional attack per turn.</p>
<h3>Spi Ack Thuan</h3>
<p>Dwarves tend to favor heavy axes and hammers, but as they took to the sea, they soon realized that carrying lots of weight was antithetical to a long and healthy maritime life. If there's one thing to say about Dwarves, it would be that they know how to shape metal into the right tool for any situation. It wasn't long until they had perfected a cutlass that was light, deadly, and perfect for shipboard combat. The combat style that evolved around it could be described in the same words. A literal word for word translation of the art would roughly be "point into giant", but a more accurate reading might be "stick the pointy end in your enemy". However, don't let the simplicity of the name fool you, masters of Spi Ack Thuan are as deadly as they are terse. Each point in this style results in Bladed Weapons getting an extra 1D and an automatic point of damage when aboard a boat or ship. Every fourth point results in an extra attack per turn on land and sea, up to a maximum of 5 attacks. After that each fouth point instead grants an extra 2 points of damage.</p>
