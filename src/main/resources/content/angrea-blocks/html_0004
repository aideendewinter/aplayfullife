The Lost House: Corvanimus

Neuros
Imperial House Neuros overthrew House Corvanimus for power in 741 CR. Since then it has played a dangerous game of “balancing the pawns.” It has fueled enmity among the other houses, trying to insure that with all the infighting no other house could grow strong enough to rival Neuros. However, the houses are beginning to get wise to Neuros’ tricks. These days Neuros walks a thin line of control indeed.
