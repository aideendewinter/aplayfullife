<h1>Neuros</h1>
<p>Imperial House Neuros overthrew House Corvanimus for power in 741 CR. Since then it has played a dangerous game of "balancing the pawns." It has fueled enmity among the other houses, trying to insure that with all the infighting no other House could grow strong enough to rival Neuros. However, the houses are beginning to get wise to Neuros' tricks. These days Neuros walks a thin line of control indeed.</p>

<li>Suzerain</li>
<li>Cousin</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perk Bonuses</h2>

<p>Your character is one of the lucky few to have been born into the family also known as House Neuros. Everyone in Chrysanthia knows the character is a member of House Neuros. They are treated with respect, though sometimes grudgingly, and few are willing to cross them. However, with the power of high birth comes the responsibilities of position. They gain the benefits of Reputation(1) with anyone that has ever spent at least a week on Chrysanthia. Once every month they are susceptible to the flaw Owed Favor(1).</p>

They have been given management of House Neuros' affairs in some city or territory of the Empire, and must work constantly to further their Houses objectives there.</p>
<h1>Silvos</h1>
<p>The Tetharius tend to be a very pragmatic race. Their long lives lend themselves to viewing things from a broad perspective. When they first founded House Silvos they were staunch allies of House Corvanimus, but after the armed coup that put House Neuros into power they were swift to adjust their allegiances. Although House Silvos places no racial requirements on who may join, only Elves, Half-elves, and Halflings have ever applied. Members of House Silvos are known as expert influencers, and are relied on by House Neuros to serve as diplomats to each of the regions of the Empire. On top of their official duties, they also project a far reaching influence over the growing industry of the public press. Young members have begun taking jobs as staff reporters, as well as putting out their own papers. Although most have a pro-Neuros slant, not all of House Silvos is happy with the status quo, especially the new generation.</p>
<h2>Ranks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initiate</li>
<li>Member</li>
<li>Elder</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perk Bonuses</h2>

They gain Repuation(House Silvos 1). They may occasionally be asked to provide information or guidance for another member of House Silvos who visits their home region.</p>
<h3>House Scion(2)</h3>
<p>Your character's hard work and diplomacy has been recognized by the leadership of House Silvos, and they have been granted the title of Member within the House. They are entrusted as diplomatic couriers, and may be called on to carry important political correspondance whenever they are travelling. They gain Contacts(1) with every person in the Empire that has the House Scion(1) perk, no matter what house.</p>

<h1>Argentus</h1>
<p>House Argentus runs 90% of the breweries and distilleries in the Empire. They make ales, spirits, and more esoteric imbibements as well. The House is 40% Dwarves, 20% Humans, and 10% Halflings. The remaining 30% is a fluctuating pool of every other race in the Empire. As the chief supplier of strength enhancing, protective and healing potions to the Empire's legions, they hold great power with the military. Many of the members are former legionnaires.</p>

<h1>Carthas</h1>
<p>House Carthas' members include all the major merchants in the Empire. Composed mostly of Sea Dwarves, Humans, and Halflings, Carthas controls nearly all the flow of goods within the Empire. They negotiate contracts with farmers, craftsmen, and other Houses, constantly attempting to use the collective power of their members to keep the prices low on numerous goods. While House Carthas' power is great, it is somewhat offset by the power of the Houses with which they are forced to negotiate. House Argentus will only allow the prices of their alcohol and magical potions to be driven down so much.</p>
