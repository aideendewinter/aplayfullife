<h1>Neuros</h1>
<p>Imperial House Neuros overthrew House Corvanimus for power in 741 CR. Since then it has played a dangerous game of "balancing the pawns." It has fueled enmity among the other houses, trying to insure that with all the infighting no other House could grow strong enough to rival Neuros. However, the houses are beginning to get wise to Neuros' tricks. These days Neuros walks a thin line of control indeed.</p>

<h1>Silvos</h1>
<p>The Tetharius tend to be a very pragmatic race. Their long lives lend themselves to viewing things from a broad perspective. When they first founded House Silvos they were staunch allies of House Corvanimus, but after the armed coup that put House Neuros into power they were swift to adjust their allegiances. Although House Silvos places no racial requirements on who may join, only Elves, Half-elves, and Halflings have ever applied. Members of House Silvos are known as expert influencers, and are relied on by House Neuros to serve as diplomats to each of the regions of the Empire. On top of their official duties, they also project a far reaching influence over the growing industry of the public press. Young members have begun taking jobs as staff reporters, as well as putting out their own papers. Although most have a pro-Neuros slant, not all of House Silvos is happy with the status quo, especially the new generation.</p>
