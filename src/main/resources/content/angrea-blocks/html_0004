<h1>Neuros</h1>
<p>Imperial House Neuros overthrew House Corvanimus for power in 741 CR. Since then it has played a dangerous game of "balancing the pawns." It has fueled enmity among the other houses, trying to insure that with all the infighting no other House could grow strong enough to rival Neuros. However, the houses are beginning to get wise to Neuros' tricks. These days Neuros walks a thin line of control indeed.</p>

<h2>Perk Bonuses</h2>

<p>Your character is one of the lucky few to have been born into the family also known as House Neuros. Everyone in Chrysanthia knows the character is a member of House Neuros.

They have been given management of House Neuros' affairs in some city or territory of the Empire, and must work constantly to further their Houses objectives there.</p>
<h1>Silvos</h1>
<p>The Tetharius tend to be a very pragmatic race. Their long lives lend themselves to viewing things from a broad perspective. When they first founded House Silvos they were staunch allies of House Corvanimus, but after the armed coup that put House Neuros into power they were swift to adjust their allegiances. Although House Silvos places no racial requirements on who may join, only Elves, Half-elves, and Halflings have ever applied. Members of House Silvos are known as expert influencers, and are relied on by House Neuros to serve as diplomats to each of the regions of the Empire. On top of their official duties, they also project a far reaching influence over the growing industry of the public press. Young members have begun taking jobs as staff reporters, as well as putting out their own papers. Although most have a pro-Neuros slant, not all of House Silvos is happy with the status quo, especially the new generation.</p>
<h2>Ranks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initiate</li>
<li>Member</li>
<li>Elder</li>
</ul>

<h3>House Scion(2)</h3>
<p>Your character's hard work and diplomacy has been recognized by the leadership of House Silvos, and they have been granted the title of Member within the House. They are entrusted as diplomatic couriers, and may be called on to carry important political correspondance whenever they are travelling. They gain Contacts(1) with every person in the Empire that has the House Scion(1) perk, no matter what house.</p>

The remaining 30% is a fluctuating pool of every other race in the Empire. As the chief supplier of strength enhancing, protective and healing potions to the Empire's legions, they hold great power with the military. Many of the members are former legionnaires.</p>

<h1>Carthas</h1>
<p>House Carthas' members include all the major merchants in the Empire. Composed mostly of Sea Dwarves, Humans, and Halflings, Carthas controls nearly all the flow of goods within the Empire. They negotiate contracts with farmers, craftsmen, and other Houses, constantly attempting to use the collective power of their members to keep the prices low on numerous goods. While House Carthas' power is great, it is somewhat offset by the power of the Houses with which they are forced to negotiate. House Argentus, Ilmath, and Brios will only allow the cost of their labors to be driven so low.</p>

<h1>Ilmath</h1>
<p>The House of crafters, Ilmath is the combined will of smiths, carpenters, weavers, and more, all throughout the Empire. Another House that is composed mostly of Humans and Dwarves, Ilmath also has what some may find to be a surprising number of Orcs and Half-Orcs, mostly representing the metal-smithing crafts. A number of succesful weavers come from Gnomish stock, and Halflings and Goblins are both known for intricate wood-work. Dwarves and Goblins dominate the jewelry industry. Humans tend to fill in the more average, everyday products, though a few human crafters do rise to artisan level.</p>

<h1>Aeth</h1>
<p>House Aeth deals in the darker side of business. Mostly known for its black market trade of stolen and illicit goods, the bulk of Aeth's political power actually comes from its person removal services. Aeth assasins are feared throughout the Empire. Nothing ruins a person's day like finding out someone has hired House Aeth to kill you. Mostly Humans, Orcs, and Half-Orcs, Aeth also has a smattering of Elves, Half-Elves, and a small handful of Gnomes. Aeth has never had, and most likely never will have, any Halfling members. There is a bitter feud between the two groups.</p>

The House has equal parts Humans, Halflings, Goblins, Shidhe, and Half-Elves, as well as a smattering of the other races as well. Legend states the House was originally founded by Bria, but within the House it is spoken of as being founded by one of her apostles, a nameless bard who chronicled the rise of the Chrysanthia Pantheon.</p>
