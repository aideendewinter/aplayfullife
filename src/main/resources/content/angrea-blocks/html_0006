<h2>Torris' Gambit</h2>
<p>Torris' Gambit, known by most as simply Gambit, is a card game played by many in the Empire. It started as a way for soldiers to pass time while waiting for battle. The game is a trick taking game utilizing the widespread Chrysanthian Trium, a deck of playing cards that is roughly equivalent to the 15th century Italion Trionfi (aka Tarocco or Tarot) from our world. The deck consists of 78 cards. Four suits of fourteen cards, and twenty-two Trium, or Trump, cards. The cards often depict historical and mythical events, and the Trium cards in particular are dedicated to particular Deities from the Angrea and Chrysanthian Pantheons.</p>
<h3>Card Naming</h3>
<p>The number and basic ordering of the Trium is identical to modern day Tarot cards, and so games designed for one may be played with the other. However, the suit names, court cards, and Trumps all have vastly different names and artstyles reflecting the culture in which they developed.<p>
