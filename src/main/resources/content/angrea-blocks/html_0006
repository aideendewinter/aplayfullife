<h2>Torris' Gambit</h2>
<p>Torris' Gambit, known by most as simply Gambit, is a card game played by many in the Empire. It started as a way for soldiers to pass time while waiting for battle. The game is a trick taking game utilizing the widespread Chrysanthian Trium, a deck of playing cards that is roughly equivalent to the 15th century Italion Trionfi (aka Tarocco or Tarot) from our world. The deck consists of 78 cards. Four suits of fourteen cards, and twenty-two Trium, or Trump, cards. The cards often depict historical and mythical events, and the Trium cards in particular are dedicated to particular Deities from the Angrea and Chrysanthian Pantheons.</p>
<h3>Card Naming</h3>
<p>The number and basic ordering of the Trium is identical to modern day Tarot cards, and so games designed for one may be played with the other. However, the suit names, court cards, and Trumps all have vastly different names and artstyles reflecting the culture in which they developed.<p>

<h3>The Rules</h3>
<p>A dealer is chosen, this is usually either the highest ranking officer or the most trusted member of the group. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals three facedown cards to each player, this is each player's hand. The deck is then placed centrally to the players, this is now the draw pile. Players view their hand, and place them face down in whatever order they wish, starting towards the draw pile, and forming a line parallel to the player, this is the player's legion. Once placed, players can no longer look at their legion cards until the final phase. Each player is then dealt a fourth facedown card from the draw pile, which is placed at the end of this line, this card is hidden from all players until the final phase, and is known as the reinforcements.</p>
<p>Starting from the dealer and proceeding left, each player now has an opportunity to choose one card from their legion and swap it's position with any other card in their legion, including their reinforcements. Once each player has either swapped two cards or passed, the final phase of the game begins. Starting with the card closest to the draw pile, all players simultaneously reveal a card. The card with the highest point value wins. Trium cards always beat the four regular suits, and Torris Fortis, which is unnumbered, beats all other cards. In the case of a tie between suited cards, Bows are beaten by Whips, which are beaten by Dragons, which are beaten by Ravens. The winning player receives all the cards currently in play, and places them face down in a pile in front of them. This represents the trick they have just won. Each succesive trick the player wins is placed perpindicular on top of this pile, creating an easily countable stack of alternating lengthwise and widthwise tricks.</p>
<p>This process is repeated for the next two cards in the legions. The player with the most tricks at this point wins the round. Depending on the number of players, a tie may be possible, in which case the players tied for first place all flip over their reinforcements. The winner of this final trick takes the round. Another round can now be played, with the previous winner becoming the dealer in the new round. Any number of rounds may be played, and the overall winner may be judged as the player with the most tricks at the end of the game, or the player who won the most rounds.</p>
<p>Different parts of the Empire have different preferences and house rules, but the common practice in Chrysanth is best x out of (number of players * (x-1) + 1) rounds(for 2 players: 2 out of 3, 5 out of 9, etc; for 5 players: 2 out of 6, 5 out of 21, etc), with the losing players often attempting to raise the value of x whenever the game is about to end not in their favor. This is often the easiest way to score games with many rounds, because the tricks can be collected and shuffled back into the draw pile without losing track of each players running total, as the number of tricks in a thirty or fifty round game can quickly become unwieldy, especially when trying to track five or more player's totals.</p>
