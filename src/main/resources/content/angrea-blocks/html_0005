<p>Only three religions can be found in almost every corner of Angrea, those of Iliana, Korin, and the Balance. Clerics of the Balance are rare, as they must keep favor with both Iliana and Korin, no matter how intense their feud becomes. However, those that are able to do so are amongst the most powerful users of divine magic in all Angrea. They also tend to be somewhat unpredictable, as they juggle their allegiances to both light and dark.</p>
<p>Angrea was not created, and so it has no creation myth. What it does have is Iliana and Korin, eternally locked in struggle for the hearts and minds of Angrea's people, and its deities. Almost all Gods are pledged to one or the other, or the Balance. Though a few do choose to go their own way. Direct worship of Iliana and Korin is only slightly more common than that of the Balance. Most people acknowledge that the two are far too busy, and have much too much real estate to cover, to care overly much about their small corner of Angrea. Still, the two do have their temples and acolytes, which can suddenly decide to take action in the world, almost as capriciously as their patrons.</p>
<p>The remainder of Angrea's Gods tend to be tied to a smaller area of the plane.</p>
