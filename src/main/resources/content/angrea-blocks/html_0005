<h1>Angrean Gods</h1>
<p>Angrea was not created, and so it has no creation myth. What it does have is Iliana and Korin, eternally locked in struggle for the hearts and minds of Angrea's people, and its deities. Almost all Gods are pledged to one or the other, or the Balance. Though a few do choose to go their own way. Direct worship of Iliana and Korin is rare. Most people acknowledge that the two are far too busy, and have much too much real estate to cover, to care overly much about their small corner of Angrea. Still, the two do have their temples and acolytes, which can suddenly decide to take action in the world, almost as capriciously as their patrons.</p>
<p>Clerics of the Balance are even more rare than clerics of Iliana and Korin, as they must keep favor with both siblings, no matter how intense their feud becomes. However, those that are able to do so are amongst the most powerful users of divine magic in all Angrea. They also tend to be somewhat unpredictable, as they juggle their allegiances to both light and dark.</p>
<h2>Iliana</h2>
<p>Iliana is the goddess of light. Her power is carried in the suns that travel above Angrea. She represents good in its purest form. That doesn't mean she always makes "good" choices however. Somtimes she can lose sight of common morality in her eternal struggle with her sister Korin. There have been many times where one of the lower Gods, or even a mortal, had to intervene and set Iliana back on the right course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Neutral Good</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Ranseur</li>
<li>Domains: Good, Healing, Luck, Protection, Trickery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Korin</h2>
<p>Like her sister Iliana, though Korin is the embodiment of evil, her motives are not always as black and white as that would make it appear. While she exists in darkness, and craves to destroy her sister and have all the lower Gods and mortals who worship her, she can occasionally show compassion, of a sort. Especially when a mortal's circumstances reminds her somehow of her own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Neutral Evil</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Guisarme</li>
<li>Domains: Death, Destruction, Evil, Trickery, Luck</li>
</ul>
<h2>Balance</h2>
<p>The Balance is not a tangible entity as are Iliana and Korin. Instead, it is an ideal, a belief that both light and dark are necessary for life to flourish. It is a position taken by only a few gods and mortals throughout all eternity. Some cultures have been built around the belief, but these are usually small and fleeting. Some of the followers of Balance believe there will come a time when Iliana and Korin will embrace the philosophy, and ease their rivalry. The siblings view this as incredibly unlikely, but both tolerate followers of the Balance in their own way, and are more than willing to grant the gift of divine magic as long as proper adulation is given in return.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Neutral</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Whip</li>
<li>Domains: Protection, Destruction, Trickery, Luck</li>
</ul>
<h1>Neuranian Gods</h1>
<p>The remainder of Angrea's Gods tend to be tied to a smaller area of the plane. They exist as patrons, either of nations, races, or cultures. Few Gods span more than one Pantheon. For this tome, the focus will be on the Gods of the Neuranian Empire. Also known as the Chrysanthian Pantheon. They rose to godhood around the same time as the founding of the original Chrysanthian Empire, and the story of their mortal lives and ascension is the backbone of Neuranian religion.</p>
<h2>Ilithor</h2>
<p>Ilithor is the God of law and order. His temples often act as de-facto small claims courts. His clerics are known for upholding truth and justice, and so are often sought to arbitrate disputes. He is pledged to Iliana, and is nominally the leader of the Chrysanthian Pantheon. He is respected among the good and neutral gods. And somewhat feared by the evil ones. In myth, at least, he adventured with Bria, Canaedus, Leonas and Ferrallia, and together they grew in power, unfortunately kept pace with by their rivals, Aetherias, Karria, Torris Fortis, Zollo, and Jahiel. He's the occasional paramore of Patrikia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Lawful Good</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Warhammer</li>
<li>Legendary: Purity</li>
<li>Domains: Law, Good, Strength, War, Nobility, Luck</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bria</h2>
<p>Known as Brius during her mortal years, Bria recently realized her true gender is that of a woman. She is pledged to Iliana. As well as becoming the celestial face of the Empire's gender revolution, Bria is also the one of the three Goddesses of untamed nature. Her particular domain is coastline, and is associated with coastline dwelling ravens in particular. Long ago she had a short but ardent affair with Karria, before either's ascension. More recently she has been known to spend time with Ferallia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Chaotic Good</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Longbow</li>
<li>Legendary: Whisper</li>
<li>Domains: Chaos, Luck, Animal, Plant, Madness, Emotion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Karria</h2>
<p>Karria is the goddess of art. She is the favored patron of musicians, actors, painters, sculptors, and writers. Nominally a follower of the Balance, Karria associates mostly with those Gods pledged to Korin. However, her short lived affair with Bria, during the middle of her courtship by Aetherias, instigated a rivalry that arguably led to the eventual ascension of the original Chrysanthian Pantheon. A rivalry that contributed to the current ongoing feud between the Gods. Since the ascension she has had short daliances with Leonas, Ferallia, Jahiel, and Coverias.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Neutral</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Dagger</li>
<li>Legendary: Fool’s Pride</li>
<li>Domains: Trickery, Charm, Mind, Fire, Madness, Sex</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aetherias</h2>
<p>Aetherias is the leader of the Chrysanthian Gods that are pledged to Korin. He is the God of Death, and his followers oversee the care of the deceased. His following is strongest in Koranthia, though small temples to him are found throughout the Empire. During his mortal years he travelled with Karria, Torris Fortis, Zollo, and Jahiel. He was deeply in love with Karria, and her affair with Bria drove him somewhat insane. It is rumored that he was the first to ascend, which he supposedly did with a dark ritual in Korin's name that cost many lives. Since ascension he has feuded with any God or mortal who dared become involved with Karria. While mostly devoted to Karria, he has had an off and on relationship with Katarina.</p>

<li>Alignment: Neutral Evil</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Whip</li>
<li>Legendary: Comforting Lie</li>
<li>Domains: Death, Destruction, Mind, Madness, Emotion, Sex</li>
</ul>
<h2>Canaedus</h2>
<p>Canaedus is the patron god of Arcane magic, and is pledged to Iliana. His temples often more resemble libraries and universities than places of religious worship. During his travels with Ilithor, Bria, Leonas and Ferrallia, he was one of the first people to accurately map the five spheres of magic. He had a short fling with Leonas, and later with Caemeer. He adores Coverias, but the attraction is unrequited.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Lawful Good</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Longsword</li>
<li>Legendary: Bitter Truth</li>
<li>Domains: Knowledge, Magic, Law, Sex, Water, Air</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leonas</h2>
<p>While Leonas originally travelled with Ilithor, Bria, Canaedus and Ferrallia, who have all pledged with Iliana, Leonas decided to take a different path. He pledged to Korin, but has little to do with Aetherius and his band. Instead, he has become Korin's personal champion, with rumors suggesting they have even shared a bed on more than one occasion. As champion of the dark Goddess, Leonas revels in spreading war and chaos. While mortal he toyed with Canaedus, and after ascension had a short relationship with Karria, but since has seemingly been devoted only to Korin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Chaotic Evil</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Unarmed</li>
<li>Legendary: Stone Strike</li>
<li>Domains: Chaos, War, Destruction, Fire, Earth, Sex</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ferallia</h2>
<p>Although pledged to Iliana, Ferallia is much more interested in the wellfare of Angrea than with any particular ambition of the Goddess of light. One of the three Goddesses of untamed nature, along with Bria and Patrikia, Ferallia claims forests as her natural domain. She is often depicted accompanied by a black panther, but is also associated strongly with horses and squirrels. She is the favored patron of centaurs. She once had a short affair with Karria, that some say led to the death of an entire forest on Koranthia. Since then she has been known to spend a lot of time with Batus, Torris Fortis, and Bria.</p>

<li>Favored Weapon: Claw Bracer</li>
<li>Legendary: Kitten’s Claw</li>
<li>Domains: Plant, Animal, Earth, Air, Fire, Water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Katarina</h2>
<p>Katarina is a more recent addition to the Chrysanthian pantheon. She ascended with the help of Aetherias, their relationship having started while she was mortal. Katarina was once a priestess of Aetherias, and her divine domain overlaps his. She is nominally pledged to Korin, but takes less interest in the feuds that drive Aetherias and most of the other evil Gods. She is responsible for ensuring that people reach their destined deaths, and is known to intervene when someone with a greater destiny is about to die prematurely. As well as her relationship with Aetherias, she has also been known to spend time with Zollo and Coverias. The latter she has grown particularly fond of, and is known to aid Coverias' followers almost as often as her own.</p>

<li>Favored Weapon: Flail</li>
<li>Legendary: "Scathing Wit”</li>
<li>Domains: Trickery, Evil, Mind, Water, Healing, Death</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caemeer</h2>
<p>Caemeer is the patron God of poets, madmen, and mathematicians. As a mortal, he travelled often with Batus and Coverias. They grew in power, and ascended with the help of Bria. Bledged to Balance, Caemeer is known to aid those who seek truth no matter how great the cost to their sanity. He occasionally spends time with Canaedus. He shares many interests with Karria, though both say it doesn't go beyond a deep friendship. Along with Batus and Coverias, he is known as one of the few Gods to have frequent relationships with mortals.</p>

<li>Alignment: Chaotic Neutral</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Bastard Sword</li>
<li>Legendary: Poet’s Tongue</li>
<li>Domains: Chaos, Luck, Protection, Travel, Math, Craft</li>
</ul>
<h2>Batus</h2>
<p>Batus is the God of the harvest. Bledged to Balance, he is looked to by farmers and gardeners of all ilks. His temples often take the form of grandiose greenhouses. As a mortal traveller with Caemeer and Coverias, his role was often as mediator between their lawful and chaotic natures. He spends a lot of time with Ferallia, and orchards are often dedicated to the pair's relationship. He also has a habit of falling in love with mortals, and many families of farmers lay claim to his divine ancestry, occasionally accurately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Neutral</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Quarterstaff</li>
<li>Legendary: Trees</li>
<li>Domains: Plant, War, Strength, Domination, Craft, Earth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Torris Fortis</h2>
<p>Torris Fortis is the God of just war. He is pledged to Balance, and his name is invoked by soldiers and, to a lesser extent, guards whenever combat becomes unavoidable. His temples in all the major cities of the Empire also serve as military academies and boot camps for the Empire's legions. As a mortal he travelled with Aetherius, Karria, Zollo, and Jahiel but grew distant from his companions as they began to make darker and darker choices. He sided with Ilithor and Bria in their battle against Aetherius, Zollo, and Jahiel which eventually led to an uneasy armistice that still holds till today. He spends most of his personal time with Ferallia, but is also a close friend of Bria.</p>

<li>Alignment: Chaotic Good</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Claymore</li>
<li>Legendary: Chaos</li>
<li>Domains: Strength, Sex, War, Chaos, Good</li>
</ul>
<h2>Zollo</h2>
<p>Zollo is the God of assasins. He is the right hand of Aetherius, and is likewise pledged to Korin. He has temples in nearly every major city of the Empire, but few outside his followers have ever seen them. He is the favored Patron of House Aeth, and they often use his temples as informal meeting houses. He has never been known to have any consorts, but it is whispered that his devotion to Aetherius goes beyond mere fealty. Few are brave enough to speak such thoughts too loudly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Neutral Evil</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Hand Crossbow</li>
<li>Legendary: Death’s Embrace</li>
<li>Domains: Fire, Death, War, Craft, Evil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jahiel</h2>
<p>Jahiel is the God of deception, and is pledged to Korin. He favors those who use deceit and manipulation to survive. His followers often masquerade as followers of others, and shrines to him can sometimes be found hidden in the temples of the other Gods. He is frequently seen in the company of Karria, and their relationship goes back and forth between friendship and lovers. Anything else that is or has been said of Jahiel is probably a lie.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Chaotic Evil</li>

<li>Legendary: Pipe Dream</li>
<li>Domains: Travel, Luck, Evil, Illusion, Darkness</li>

<h2>Patrikia</h2>
<p>Patrikia is the third Goddess of untamed nature. She is pledged to Balance, and her domain encompasses open plains and grasslands. She is often depicted with deer antlers either rising out of her forehead or in silhouette behind it. Her temples tend to be rest stops along the roads that criss cross the Empire, and her followers act effectively as innkeepers. She has an off and on again relationship with Ilithor.

<h2>Coverias</h2>
<p>Coverias isn't pledged to Iliana or Korin. Instead, e follows his own moral code. E is the deity of the ocean, and is called upon by sailors, especially pirates. Eir temples tend to be small shrines aboard ships, especially on Sea Dwarf vessels. The Sea Dwarfs particularly worship Coverias, and build a shrine to em in every ship they build. E had a short fling with Karria, and a longer on and off again relationship with Katarina that continues to this day. E also frequently forms relationships with notable captains and pirates, but only sometimes reveals eir divine nature to eir partners.</p>
