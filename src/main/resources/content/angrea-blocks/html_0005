<p>Angrea was not created, and so it has no creation myth. What it does have is Iliana and Korin, eternally locked in struggle for the hearts and minds of Angrea's people, and its deities. Almost all Gods are pledged to one or the other, or the Balance. Though a few do choose to go their own way. Direct worship of Iliana and Korin is rare. Most people acknowledge that the two are far too busy, and have much too much real estate to cover, to care overly much about their small corner of Angrea. Still, the two do have their temples and acolytes, which can suddenly decide to take action in the world, almost as capriciously as their patrons.</p>
<p>Clerics of the Balance are even more rare than clerics of Iliana and Korin, as they must keep favor with both Iliana and Korin, no matter how intense their feud becomes. However, those that are able to do so are amongst the most powerful users of divine magic in all Angrea. They also tend to be somewhat unpredictable, as they juggle their allegiances to both light and dark.</p>
<p>The remainder of Angrea's Gods tend to be tied to a smaller area of the plane. They exist as patrons, either of nations, races, or cultures. Few Gods span more than one Pantheon. For this tome, the focus will be on the Gods of the Neuranian Empire. Also known as the Chrysanthian Pantheon. They rose to godhood around the same time as the founding of the original Crysanthian Empire, and the story of their mortal lives and ascension is the backbone of Neuranian religion.</p>
<h1>Angrean Gods</h1>
<h2>Iliana</h2>
<p>Iliana is the goddess of light. Her power is carried in the suns that travel above Angrea. She represents good in its purest form. That doesn't mean she always makes "good" choices however. Somtimes she can lose sight of common morality in her eternal struggle with her sister Korin. There have been many times where one of the lower Gods, or even a mortal, had to intervene and set Iliana back on the right course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Neutral Good</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Ranseur</li>
<li>Domains: Good, Healing, Luck, Protection, Trickery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Korin</h2>
<p>Like her sister Iliana, though Korin is the embodiment of evil, her motives are not always as black and white as that would make it appear. While she exists in darkness, and craves to destroy her sister and have all the lower Gods and mortals worship her, she can occasionally show compassion, of a sort. Especially when a mortal's circumstances reminds her somehow of her own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment: Neutral Evil</li>
<li>Favored Weapon: Guisarme</li>
<li>Domains: Death, Destruction, Evil, Trickery, Luck</li>
</ul>
<h2>Balance</h2>
<p>The balance is not a tangible identity as are Iliana and Korin. Instead, it is an ideal, a belief that both light and dark are necessary for life to flourish. It is a position taken by only a few gods and mortals throughout all eternity. Some cultures have been built around the belief, but these are usually small and fleeting. Some of the followers of Balance believe there will come a time when Iliana and Korin will embrace the philosophy, and ease their rivalry. The siblings view this as incredibly unlikely, but both tolerate followers of the balance in their own way, and are more than willing to grant the gift of divine magic as long as proper adulation is given in return.</p>
