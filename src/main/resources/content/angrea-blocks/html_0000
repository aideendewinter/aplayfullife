<p>All games require rules, and the Angrea Roleplaying Game(RPG) is no exception. Angrea uses a modified version of the Open D6 system. Specifically, it draws most of its basic conventions from Mini Six. However, a number of rules have been tweaked, and a number of new systems added, in order to capture the essence of adventuring in the Neuranian Empire. Below you will find a brief overview of the core systems, with more detailed rules laid out in the children sections.</p>
<h1>Action Resolution</h1>
<p>At the core of any RPG is its mechanics for determining the outcome of a character’s action. Did my sword hit the bandit? How hurt is e? Can I climb up the side of this cliff? Can I convince the guard that I belong in this hallway? Many different mechanics have been invented to answer these types of questions in games. Most use dice. Some use many different types of dice, with odd shapes, that you can only get in specialized gaming shops or online. Angrea uses D6s, or six-sided die, as you muggles out there may know them. The same dice often used in classic board and casino games. The ones you can get roughly a dozen of at the dollar store.</p>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>Dice rolls, attributes, damage, and other game mechanics use a specialized notation in Angrea. This notation is called a dice pool. Dice pools are written as a number, followed by a capital ‘D’. The ‘D’ stands for die six, and the number represents the quantity you should roll. Often, a plus sign and another number can follow the ‘D’. This other number is a static bonus to add to the total dots shown on the die. Like those dots, the value is referred to as the ‘pips’. In certain circumstances you may have to convert between die and pips. In these situations 1D is equal to +3 pips, and you cannot have a single dice pool with more than two pips. For instance, 2D+4 would become 3D+1.</p>
<h2>Basic Mechanics</h2>
<p>When performing an action, the GM will first determine which skill would cover the action, and how difficult the action is to perform. The difficulty will determine a target number. The player will then select an attribute to combine with this skill, adding together the values on eir character sheet to arrive at a combined dice pool. Selecting the attribute represents applying the skill in various ways. For example, Susan’s character Grimble wishes to attack an animated skeleton with eir hammer. E could choose to swing the hammer with all eir might, combining Strength with eir Blunt Weapons skill to crush eir opponent.</p>
<p>Alternatively, e might choose to target the skeleton’s spine, using Agility with Blunt Weapons, either in the hopes the GM might decide that a success would warrant extra damage, or to utilize a specific style of fighting e has learned that relies on Agility. In either case, Susan adds together the dice pools from Grimble’s attribute and skill, then rolls the combined dice pool, seeking to beat the predetermined target number that represents the skeletons ability to dodge or parry eir attacks. When combining dice pools for combat or skill checks, the GM may optionally ignore the rule on max pips. This allows for making sure the amount of dice being rolled at once doesn’t get unruly. More details on skills and combat can be found in their respective sections.</p>
<p>When rolling a dice pool, one die is always designated as the wild die. This can be designated by a differently colored die, or simply by rolling the final die separately from the others. If the dice pool only has one die, consider that die the wild die. If the wild die results in a six, this value is added to the current total as normal, but the wild die is then rolled again. Continue doing this until a number other than six is rolled, adding each value to the current total as you go. If the wild die results in a one the first time it is rolled, add the value to your die total, and let the GM know you had a critical failure when you tell them the total. They will determine what if any effect this will have on the action.</p>
