<p>Angrea is a world of infinities, a plane that extends outward in all directions from Emith’s Heart. It has existed forever, eternally the playground of Iliana and Korin, the deities of Light and Dark. However, these two deities are the only constant. Even the other gods rise and fall with the empires and kingdoms of which they are the patrons. It is hard to describe such a world. Imagine any story you’ve ever loved. Now imagine it takes place on an infinite plane, and occasionally the narrative is interrupted by a pair of feuding omnipotent siblings, who occasionally impart vast wisdom, but more often behave like petulant children. Chances are that’s happening somewhere on Angrea. Are you imagining a science fiction story of sentient robots overthrowing their human creators and imprisoning them in pods to be used as batteries? If you travel far enough, and in the right direction, you’ll find that happening. More than once, actually. Identical to the story you may now have in mind. And also countless versions that are different only because the antagonist is named Professor Smythe.</p>
