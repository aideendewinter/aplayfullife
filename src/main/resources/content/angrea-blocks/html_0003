<p>In order to adventure within Angrea, you must first create a persona to serve as your avatar within this new world. You can create a heroic fighter, a stealthy rogue, or a spell-wielding wizard. Or you can combine these tropes and others to create interesting new hybrids. You can even attempt to create a completely original character, unlike anything anyone has ever seen (but it’s not easy). At its simplest, your character is defined by a series of attributes and skills. However, after that you can also decide where your character came from, what e’s good at, what eir goals are, and then get to guide eir growth as e becomes more powerful and clever as eir story unfolds.</p>
<h1>Races Of Angrea</h1>
<p>During the Flood, all the nations of Angrea were wiped out with one fell swoop. Countless perished, races were wiped out, pantheons fell. But here and there, through magic or other means, the clever and the strong survived. As the waters receded the remaining races emerged to find a new and deadly world awaited them. It was either adapt or die, and so they adapted.</p>
<p>Choosing a race can affect starting values for attributes and skills, as well as granting additional perks. Bonuses and penalties to attributes are adjustments to the maximum starting dice pools, all characters still start with 18D total. All characters can be assumed to have 1D in the history and customs of their race and region. It’s best to have at least a rough idea of what race you want your character to be before continuing with character creation. More about the culture and politics of the races may be found on the site under [The World].</p>
<h2>Humans</h2>
<p>Humans are the most prevalent race in Angrea, and though their lives burn swift, they burn bright. Some of the greatest accomplishments of ages past have been at the hands of Humans. However, so have some of the greatest atrocities. The Humans’ ambition and pride make them capable of great things, but whether great good or great evil is in their hands. In the Neuranian Empire, Humans hold the highest levels of power, the ruling House, House Neuros, is entirely Human and has strict rules of ancestral descent in order to join.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 80 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 175 cm</li>
<li>Starting Languages : Chrysanthian</li>
<li>+1 Starting Perk, +2D Starting Skill Die</li>
</ul>
<h2>Elves</h2>
<p>Descended from the sea-dwelling Natharius, the land Elves of Angrea are prone to wanderlust and a desire to live near the sea. Always yearning for the freedom of the waves, the land Elves, or Tetharius, are the most conflicted race of the isles. This yearning drives some Elves to abandon the kingdoms of humanity in search of a way to once again join their sea-dwelling brethren in the freedom of the deeps. The Tetharius that inhabit the Neuranian Empire are the second most influential race in Empire politics, they make up the greater portion of House Silvos, which has served as direct advisers to House Neuros since their rise to power.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 600 years<br />
It is rare to see Tetharius past the age of 400. It is around that time they often set off to rejoin their Natharius cousins.</li>
<li>Average Height : 190 cm</li>
<li>Starting Languages : Chrysanthian, Teth (a sibling dialect of Nath, the two languages are related much as Spanish and Italian are in our world)</li>
<li>Endurance +1D, Strength -1D</li>
<li>Low-light vision</li>
<li>Tetharius still bear a hint of their ocean-dwelling ancestry. They get an additional 4D when attempting to hold their breath, and an additional 2D to swimming checks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dwarves</h2>
<p>Under hill and beneath stone, long have the Dwarves lived closely to Angrea’s heart. They’ve forged miracles out of metal and shaped wonder out of stone. During the Flood, the Dwarves allied with the gnomes in order to seal tight their mountain kingdoms against the water and import air from the surface using clever Gnomish devices. The Dwarves and Gnomes still live side by side and work together to forge a place in this new world. In this new age, where trade depends greatly on sea routes, some dwarves have adapted their craftsmanship to become master shipwrights.</p>
<p>This new breed of dwarves are known as sea dwarfs. The dwarves of the mountain kingdoms are now known as stone dwarves. The stone dwarves are the most likely to be seen in the courts of the Empire, though the occasional sea dwarf is not unheard of. House Carthas’ dwarven contingent is almost entirely sea dwarves, and House Ilmath has quite a few members of both dwarven races.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 400 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 90 cm</li>
<li>Languages : Chrysanthian, Dwarven, Gnomish</li>
<li>Strength +1D, Endurance +1D, Agility -2D</li>
<li>Low-light vision</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stone Dwarves</h3>
<p>Like their ancient ancestors the stone dwarves take to metal and stone like second nature. They find their homes in the caves and mountains of the isles and rely on their seafaring brethren to bring the outside trade to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stone dwarves are masters of minerals, they get an additional 3D on any skill check involving metal or stone (including gemstones).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sea Dwarves</h3>
<p>The sea dwarves have adapted their mastery over metal to building and manning great seagoing vessels. No ship can cut through the Angrean seas like a dwarven galley.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sea dwarves are the greatest shipwrights in the Empire, they get an additional 3D on any skill check involving metal, wood, and sailing. They suffer no difficulty in seeing the stars despite moderate light pollution or haze. Dense fog and daylight still obscure their vision as usual.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gnomes</h2>
<p>The gnomes have lived closely with the dwarves for some time now. During the Flood they used their inventions to bring air from the surface down to the airtight mountain fortresses of the dwarves. They can now be found both in the great mountain kingdoms of the stone dwarves and the industrious port cities of the sea dwarves. Those gnomes more closely tied to their mountain cousins are known as rock gnomes. Those favoring the seafaring life are known as river gnomes. In the Neuranian Empire they can be found serving as court alchemists and inventors. They rarely join Houses, though some can be found in House Argentus. Instead they slip around behind the scenes of court intrigue, shaping events by ‘accidentally’ dropping a word here and there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 200 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 100 cm</li>
<li>Languages : Chrysanthian, Dwarven, Gnomish</li>
<li>Strength -1D, Endurance -1D, Agility +1D, Reason +1D</li>
<li>Low-light vision</li>
<li>Gnomes are masters of invention, they start with 1D in Mechanical Engineering, and may have a total of 4D.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rock Gnomes</h3>
<p>The rock gnomes labor industriously next to their dwarven kin, crafting new and wondrous inventions everyday. They scour through the mountains, looking for just the right part or ingredient to complete their next gadget or potion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rock gnomes specialize in mining, they start with 3D in Mechanical Engineering: Mining Equipment, and may have a total of 6D. Specialization die still count against their increased 4D skill limit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>River Gnomes</h3>
<p>The river gnomes have abandoned the musty caves of their ancestors to take to the oceans with their sea dwarf brethren. They use their wit and clever gadgets to enhance the ships built by their less inventive cousins.</p>
<ul>
<li>River gnomes specialize in sailing, they start with 2D in Mechanical Engineering: Sails, and 2D in Mechanical Engineering: Navigational Devices, and may have a total of 6D in either. Specialization die still count against their increased 4D skill limit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Orcs</h2>
<p>Orcs, known in their native tongue of Karee as Vembila (the People), have the reputation of being a war-loving people. While they do value combat expertise, it is usually not to the complete disregard of intellectual pursuits. In modern Empire society, there is still some bigotry against Vembila. They can find it hard to gain employment beyond manual labor and security. Recently, however, they have started to unionize, demanding better wages and more safety in the factories and mines driving the current economic boom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 60 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 200 cm</li>
<li>Languages : Chrysanthian, Karee</li>
<li>Strength +1D, Endurance +2D, Agility -1D, Reason -2D</li>
<li>Low-light vision</li>
<li>Gain an additional 3D on all attack rolls when fighting to defend a fellow Vembila, either in body or to defend their honor. Gain an additional 2D on any checks involving military and combat strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Halflings</h2>
<p>No one really knows where the halflings came from. Most are fairly sure they weren’t there before the Shattering. No records of their existence are found until 3056 BCR, when a Chrysanthian scholar notes the appearance of a ‘short and agile people, darker of complexion. Though not as dark as say a sea dwarf or the pirate nations of the south. They are fond of games and can often be found “borrowing” some object, usually someone else’s personal belonging, in order to investigate its practical use in any number of oddly named pastimes. Examples include; “Hollowhide”, “Keep away from the orcling”, and “isityoursorisitmine”. They seem mostly harmle…’, at this point the dissertation stops suddenly and is replaced by large scrawling letters apparently written by fingertip, ‘…”borrowed” pen. Should send little beggars to Koranthia’.</p>
<p>While not quite as “playful” as their ancestors, modern day Halflings are still known to be agile and thrill-seeking. Quite a few take up careers with the Thieve’s Guild. They can also be found in politics, under House Silvos or House Carthas more often than not. They tend to have a disproportionate influence on the Neuranian economy that most merchants in the Empire have learned not to question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 125 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 125 cm</li>
<li>Languages : Chrysanthian, Hollytalk (argot, slightly related to Serpish, the cant originating in the Snake Isles and used by entertainers and prostitutes)</li>
<li>Strength -2D, Agility +1D, Perception +1D</li>
<li>Halflings have an odd relationship with trade and money. They get an additional 4D on any skill checks involving the subjects. They also start with Wealth(1) and Reputation(Halfling 1).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goblins</h2>
<p>Like the Vembila, Goblins have gotten a nasty reputation over the years. Often considered to be greedy and cruel, Goblins have found it hard to find work outside of the darker side of the economy. They are often relegated to careers as fences, thieves, bookies, and bankers. From their own perspective, they see themselves as pragmatic, good with numbers, and cautious of outsiders. It’s a little known fact that Goblins have a strong literary tradition, evolving from the oral histories and fables of their people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 150 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 125 cm</li>
<li>Languages : Chrysanthian, Koran</li>
<li>Strength -2D, Perception +2D</li>
<li>Goblins are extremely good at math. They get an additional 4D when checking the accuracy of any ledger, or when ascertaining whether someone is trying to deceive them about numbers of any kind. They also start with Wealth(1) and Reputation(Goblin 1).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sidhe</h2>
<p>The sidhe are magical beings, mostly living in the region known as the Fey isles. Their society hasn't changed much, since the Flood, owing partly to their long lifespans, and partly to the fact that their capital city still exists, unharmed, kilometers below the ocean's surface, protected from the, in their view, recent catastrophes that threw all the other races into chaos. Preserved by magic, Avernon is still the hub of Sidhe learning and culture, and those living in the Isles visit often. At least every couple hundred years. They sometimes even allow other races to visit, though what we consider a weekend trip can, for a Sidhe, last months or years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : ~3000 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 200 cm</li>
<li>Languages : Chrysanthian, Fey, Plant, Any One (Mammal, Reptile, Avian, Aquatic)</li>
<li>Strength -1D, Endurance -1D, Agility -1D, Perception +2D, Resolve +1D</li>
<li>Due to their magical nature, sidhe start with 2D in Arcane Engineering (either in the general skill, or converted into specialization die), and can have a max of 5D.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Mixed Race</h1>
<p>Mixed race children are becoming more and more common in the Empire. Almost all humanoid races can interbreed, including races that can take humanoid shape temporarily, such as dragons. Below is a sampling of some of the possible combinations you may see travelling the Isles.</p>
<h2>Half-Elves</h2>
<p>More so than many others of mixed heritage, Half-Elves tend to find themselves torn between two worlds. Often still in adolecense when their Human parents are elderly and dying, they find themselves moved to the culture of their Elven parent, and find Tetharius culture a tight fit, as they quickly outpace their Tetharius cousins in ambition and maturity. As such they are known more than any other race to take to a life of wandering adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 200 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 185 cm</li>
<li>Starting Languages : Chrysanthian, Teth</li>
<li>Endurance +1D, Strength -1D</li>
<li>Low-light vision</li>
<li>+1 Starting Perks</li>
<li>They get an additional 2D when attempting to hold their breath, and an additional 1D to swimming checks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Half-Orcs</h2>
<p>Half-Orcs tend to identify more with their Vembila heritage than their Human side. This is partly because the Vembila welcome them more openly, but also because it's impossible not to see their Orc heritage. Many Half-Orcs can pass as full-blooded Vembila, but very few could pass as Human. As such they tend to be found in the same menial labor jobs as their cousins, and also in the ranks of those organising for change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Expectancy : 75 years</li>
<li>Average Height : 190 cm</li>
<li>Starting Languages : Chrysanthian, Karee</li>
<li>Strength +1D, Endurance +1D, Agility -1D, Reason -1D</li>
<li>Low-light vision</li>
<li>+2 Starting Skill Die</li>
<li>Gain an additional 2D on any checks involving military and combat strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Character Region</h1>
<p>You have the opportunity to choose a home region for your character that will help further define and set your character apart from the other heroes that wander the Isles. Character region can influence perk and flaw selection, spell choice, and other aspects of character creation. It can also serve as a great foundation for a unique character history.</p>
<h2>The Regions</h2>
<img src="/images/angrea/RegionMap.png" alt="A color-coded map of the fifteen regions of the Neuranian Empire.">
<p>The following are brief descriptions of the regions and how they affect character creation. For more detailed information on the peoples and customs of each region check under [The World].</p>
<h3>Badger Isles</h3>
<p>People living in the Badger Isles tend to prefer a quiet life of farming and solitude. Families are often small, and not much heed is paid to extended familial ties. However, they are ferocious when that solitude is intruded on. The people in the Badger isles have taken on physical traits of their namesake, most are shorter than others of their race, and are fond of working in the earth. A few have developed a distinctive white streak down the center of their hair. They get +2D on skill checks involving burrowing and earth based creatures. They also receive +4D on attack rolls when fighting anything 2 or more size categories larger than themselves.</p>
<h3>Bear Isles</h3>
<p>The Bear Isles are mostly home to fisher-folk. They live in modest cottages along the shores and rivers. In the winter they tend to withdaw into their tight-knit communities and not reappear until the fish breeding season begins. They tend to be larger and bulkier than others in their race, and grow a considerable amount of body hair, even the elves, who due to their aquatic heritage tend to be on the smoother side. While fishing poles and nets are common, the focus for young Bear Islanders is on the spear, which they train with religiously almost as early as they can hold it aloft. Those raised here gain +2D on fishing checks. Their Strength may start +1D higher than they would normally be allowed, and they recieve +1 on attack rolls when wielding a spear.</P>
<h3>Chrysanthia</h3>
<h3>Dolphin Isles</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Dragon Isles</h3>
<h3>Fey Isles</h3>
<h3>Horse Isles</h3>
<h3>Koranthia</h3>
<h3>Raven Isles</h3>
<h3>Shark Isles</h3>
<h3>Snake Isles</h3>
<h3>Spider Isles</h3>
<h3>Stag Isles</h3>
<h3>Turtle Isles</h3>
<h3>Wolf Isles</h3>
<h1>Attributes</h1>
<p>Your character’s attributes define eir innate abilities. The six attributes describe the basic physical and mental properties that are shared between all creatures. Attributes are not immutable, but they are harder to raise than skills, which are described later in this section.</p>
<p class="note">Note: Grimble is a halfling, so eir Agility and Perception may start up to 5D, but eir Strength may not start above 2D.</p>
<p>Characters start with 18D to distribute among all six attributes. All attributes must have at least 1D, and no more than 4D. So at the end you should have something resembling Grimble’s attributes, like so:</p>
<p>Strength: 2D, Endurance: 2D, Agility: 5D, Perception: 4D, Resolve: 2D, Reason: 3D</p>
<h2>Strength</h2>
<p>Strength represents your character’s ability to exert pure physical force. Whether swinging a hammer, pushing a boulder, or crushing a watermelon, this attribute determines eir ability to shape the world through brute might.</p>
<h2>Endurance</h2>
<p>Endurance is eir physical fortitude. It describes your character’s ability to sustain prolonged physical activity. As well as eir ability to withstand physical harm. Examples of utilizing endurance include running a marathon, holding up a collapsing doorway, or resisting a poison.</p>
<h2>Agility</h2>
<p>Agility describes your character’s balance and coordination. It governs the ability to perform graceful acrobatic feats, as well as finer coordination, such as the dexterity to perform sleight-of-hand. Increasing agility will allow your character to leap out of harm’s way, fire precision weapons, or pick-pocket an aristocrat’s fat purse.</p>
<h2>Perception</h2>
<p>Perception involves both the acuteness of your character’s senses, as well as their ability to notice important details and patterns. Is that merchant lying about the quality of eir goods? Did the forest suddenly get abnormally quiet? Are the members of that House behaving differently? Your character’s perception will dictate what, if anything, e notices.</p>
<h2>Resolve</h2>
<p>Resolve describes your character’s ability to maintain a course of action in the face of adversity. Whether being faced with fatigue, intoxication, or torture, resolve is eir ability to remained focused on eir true objectives.</p>
<h2>Reason</h2>
<p>Reason determines your character’s ability to understand complex ideas or concoct new ones. Whether working within science or magic, reason drives the ability to master a field, as well as innovate within it. Your character draws on reason when using magic, crafting a mechanism, or working out the truth of a complex situation.</p>
<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>Skills represent the knowledge and aptitudes your character has acquired through training and practice. They are easier to improve than attributes, but cover a narrower range of actions. Skills are typically used in conjunction with an attribute, as described in the game mechanics section. The pairing must make sense, and the final ruling of what pairs are suitable for a given action is left up to the GM. Recommended pairings are listed in the skills section, but always be on the lookout for new ways to use old skills. If your character finds emself bound by the wrists, e may not be able to attack, but that doesn’t mean e can’t put eir knowledge of Bladed Weapons to some other use.</p>
<p>Characters can also specialize in certain aspects of a skill. Some suggested specializations are also noted in the skills section, but are by no means exhaustive. If you think of another specialization your character should know, run it by your GM. The GM has final say as to which skills and specializations your character has access. Specializations are purchased with specialization die. The skills are broken down into six categories. These categories represent related skills, and some categories have special behavior regarding specialization.</p>
<p>Your character starts with 12D to distribute, and no skill may start at more than 2D skill die including specialization die. You can split a skill die into three specialization die. You can use these specialization die for a single specialization, or spread them over completely unrelated specializations. No specialization may start with more than 3D in specializations. Below is a list of skills available to characters in Angrea. Check out [The Rules -> Skills] for more details and for examples of using skills in action.</p>

<h1>Perks</h1>
<p>Perks are talents or circumstances that a character can use to eir benefit. These can include wealth, items, magical or divine abilities, or even reputation or contacts. Knowing the right person can often be more valuable than a fistful of gold. Most characters start with one Perk, however, a player can choose to give a character Flaws as well, and for each Flaw a character has, e may have an additional perk as well. The GM has final say on how many Flaws e thinks a character should be able to start with. Three is the recommended limit for new characters. However, if a player comes up with a really excellent roleplaying rationale for why eir character should start with a certain set of Flaws and Perks, and it happens to stretch that limit, don't be afraid to bend the rules in favor of great storytelling.</p>
<h2>Wealth</h2>
<p>It's good to be rich. Each perk spent on wealth allows the character access to an ever deepening supply of riches, which can be spent on luxorious accomadations, the finest standard equipment, and even personal pages and valets. However, wealth can never be spent on mercenaries to fight alongside you, magical or unique items, or permanent housing. Perks must be spent on these seperately. The character's wealth can be derived from family, land holdings, or other investments. Perhaps they're the silent partner in a blacksmith or tavern. However their wealth flows to them, occasionally the GM should feel free to have circumstance threaten their cash cow. Perhaps their parents move to disown them, or their lands are under attack by bandits, making it impossible to collect rent. It takes work to remain wealthy.</p>
<h3>Wealth (1)</h3>
<p>A character with one point of wealth is considered middle class. They can afford to stay at modest inns and hotels indefinitely, or rent a small house in the poorer parts of Angrea. They can afford food and average equipment and repairs. Once a month they can afford the services of a temple in lifting a curse or performing an extraordinary act of healing. They can never avail themselves of this service more than once within thirty days, no matter how long they have gone without needing it prior to that month.</p>
<h3>Wealth (2)</h3>
<p>A character with two points of wealth is considered lower nobility. They can afford to stay at high end inns and hotels indefinitely, or rent a small house in the middle class parts of Angrea. They can afford extravagant food and masterwork equipment and repairs. Twice a month they can afford the services of a temple in lifting a curse or performing an extraordinary act of healing. They can never avail themselves of this service more than twice within thirty days, no matter how long they have gone without needing it prior to that month.</p>
<h3>Wealth (3)</h3>
<p>A character with three points of wealth is considered nobility. They can afford to stay at high end inns and hotels indefinitely, or rent a large house in the middle class parts of Angrea. They can afford extravagant food and masterwork equipment and repairs. Four times a month they can afford the services of a temple in lifting a curse or performing an extraordinary act of healing. They can never avail themselves of this service more than four times within thirty days, no matter how long they have gone without needing it prior to that month. They gain the benefits of Reputation(1) within the seat of their family's holdings.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>There are many ways to become known in Angrea. You can be born into a powerful family, or you can be a prodigy in a field. However your character's name spreads, Reputation represents the sway of eir celebrity. When adding a point to reputation, players must select a group or culture where the reputation resides. With each point in reputation a character's legend swells, closer to the day when they are a household name in all the Empire.</p>
<h3>Reputation (1)</h3>
<p>Characters with one point in reputation gain favorable responses from those within their chosen social circle. Their name, or at least their family's name, is recognized, and looked upon well. Skill checks to influence or intimidate those who know of them have a -2 difficulty. NPCs will often try to aid characters, as long as doing so doesn't go against their own self-interest.</p>
<h3>Reputation (2)</h3>
<p>Characters with two points in reputation gain friendly responses from those within those circles. Their name is known, and looked upon well. Skill checks to influence or intimidate those who know of them have a -4 difficulty. NPCs will often try to aid characters, as long as doing so doesn't put them in way of physical harm.</p>
<h3>Reputation (3)</h3>
<p>Characters with three points in reputation gain responses of admiration from those within those circles. Their name is well known, and looked upon with awe. Skill checks to influence or intimidate those who know of them have a -6 difficulty. NPCs will often try to aid characters, as long as doing so doesn't pose certain death. Characters at this level of reputation have become so well known that even those in other circles have a slight awareness of the character, they gain the benefits of Reputation (1) with every intelligent creature in the Empire.</p>
<h2>Ally</h2>
<p>Angrea is a dangerous place, and friends are essential. With each point in Ally, the character gains more benefits from the friendships e has garnered.</p>
<h3>Ally (1)</h3>
<p>With one point in Ally, the character gains a close friend that will accompany and aid the character however possible. The player can make suggestions for what the ally should do, but the GM has control of their actions. The ally should be a little weaker than the player's character, and doesn't gain experience seperately, instead leveling as the character does.</p>
<h3>Ally (2)</h3>
<p>With two points in Ally, the character gains the aid of a small organization. This can be anything from a local guild to another adventuring group. The group is willing to aid the character with information, and occasionally for a handful of members to join the character on adventures. They will act in the characters best interest whenever possible. How far reaching this aid can go is up to the GM's discretion.</p>
<h3>Ally (3)</h3>
<p>With three points in Ally, the character gains a small following. Followers will do their best to fulfill any of the character's requests. They will adventure with the character, or handle business or personal affairs on their behalf. They are significantly weaker than the character, and if they are put in danger or a number of them are killed, the character may lose all eir followers.</p>
<h2>House Scion</h2>
The benefits of joining a house are many. But most memberships come at a cost. Each House is unique, and the benefits and drawbacks of each are listed under [The Rules -> Character Creation -> The Houses].
<h1>Flaws</h1>
<h2>Owed Favor</h2>
The character has fallen into the debt of someone who does not take repayment lightly. In some circumstances the character may be able to buy off the favor with simple wealth. More often than not, however, they must complete some task, or some ongoing role, in order to earn their freedom.
