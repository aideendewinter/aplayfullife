You've stumbled upon the digital home of my RPG and campaign setting, Angrea. The game is still being fleshed out, but feel free to explore and use the rules and settings within for your own games. If you have feedback or suggestions drop me a line here, or through social media. If you run a game in Angrea I'd love to hear how it goes. So, pull up a chair and roll a D6, adventure awaits!
