<h1>Perks</h1>
<h2>Wealth</h2>
<p>It's good to be rich. Each perk spent on wealth allows the character access to an ever deepening supply of riches, which can be spent on luxorious accomadations, the finest standard equipment, and even personal pages and valets. However, wealth can never be spent on mercenaries to fight alongside you, magical or unique items, or permanent housing. Perks must be spent on these seperately. The character's wealth can be derived from family, land holdings, or other investments. Perhaps they're the silent partner in a blacksmith or tavern. However their wealth flows to them, occasionally the GM should feel free to have circumstance threaten their cash cow. Perhaps their parents move to disown them, or their lands are under attack by bandits, making it impossible to collect rent. It takes work to remain wealthy.</p>

<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>There are many ways to become known in Angrea. You can be born into a powerful family, or you can be a prodigy in a field. However your character's name spreads, Reputation represents the sway of eir celebrity. When adding a point to reputation, players must select a group or culture where the reputation resides. With each point in reputation a character's legend swells, closer to the day when they are a household name in all the Empire.</p>

<p>Characters with one point in reputation gain favorable responses from those within their chosen social circle. Their name, or at least their family's name, is recognized, and looked upon well. Skill checks to influence or intimidate those who know of them have a -2 difficulty. NPCs will often try to aid characters, as long as doing so doesn't go against their own self-interest.</p>
<h3>Reputation (2)</h3>
<p>Characters with two points in reputation gain friendly responses from those within those circles. Their name is known, and looked upon well. Skill checks to influence or intimidate those who know of them have a -4 difficulty. NPCs will often try to aid characters, as long as doing so doesn't put them in way of physical harm.</p>
<h3>Reputation (3)</h3>
<p>Characters with three points in reputation gain responses of admiration from those within those circles. Their name is well known, and looked upon with awe. Skill checks to influence or intimidate those who know of them have a -6 difficulty. NPCs will often try to aid characters, as long as doing so doesn't pose certain death. Characters at this level of reputation have become so well known that even those in other circles have a slight awareness of the character, they gain the benefits of Reputation (1) with every intelligent creature in the Empire.</p>
<h2>Ally</h2>
<p>Angrea is a dangerous place, and friends are essential. With each point in Ally, the character gains more benefits from the friendships e has garnered.</p>
<h3>Ally (1)</h3>
<p>With one point in Ally, the character gains a close friend that will accompany and aid the character however possible.

The ally should be a little weaker than the player's character, and doesn't gain experience seperately, instead leveling as the character does.</p>
<h3>Ally (2)</h3>
<p>With two points in Ally, the character gains the aid of a small organization. This can be anything from a local guild to another adventuring group. The group is willing to aid the character with information, and occasionally for a handful of members to join the character on adventures. They will act in the characters best interest whenever possible. How far reaching this aid can go is up to the GM's discretion.</p>
<h3>Ally (3)</h3>
<p>With three points in Ally, the character gains a small following. Followers will do their best to fulfill any of the character's requests. They will adventure with the character, or handle business or personal affairs on their behalf. They are significantly weaker than the character, and if they are put in danger or a number of them are killed, the character may lose all eir followers.</p>

The benefits of joining a house are many. But most memberships come at a cost. Each House is unique, and the benefits and drawbacks of each are listed under [The Rules -> Character Creation -> The Houses].
<h1>Flaws</h1>
