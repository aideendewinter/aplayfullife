<h1>A World of Magic</h1>
<p>Angrea is a world rich in magic. It permeates the plane, and allows for the immortal existance of its Gods. The Gods are embodiments and channels for the plane's magic, but it existed before all but Iliana and Korin, and will most likely exist long after the Neuranian Empire and its Gods have disappeared from history.</p>
<p>A number of rules define how magic is used in Angrea. Whether casters are weaving effects on the spot, or channeling pre-memorized spells, the rules affect how much skill they require, and how many successes they must achieve from their dice pool in order to pull off the reality bending effects that magic allows.</p>
<h1>Spheres of Magic</h1>
<p>There are five spheres of magic. They encompass every connection where magic can interact with Angrea. Before Canaedus it was believed there were only four spheres, but as a mortal he was able to map out and prove the fifth sphere, known as either Life or Replication, depending on how pedantic the speaker is, as well as formulate an elegant proof of why it is the final sphere that will ever be discovered. This hasn't stopped meta-magic theoriticians from occasionally proposing six or more spheres, though such theories rarely gain much traction with practical arcane engineers.</p>
<h2>Light</h2>
<h2>Sound</h2>
<h2>Magnetism</h2>
<h2>Matter</h2>
<h2>Replication</h2>
<h1>Arcane Mastery</h1>
<p>An arcane engineer's mastery is the measure of how powerful an effect their spells can produce. It is directly tied to their dice pool in the Arcane Engineering skill.</p>
<h2>Modification</h2>
<p>The simplest form of spell, modification mastery is gained with 1D in Arcane Engineering. Modification can move and reshape whatever sphere the caster is working within. Light and sound modification is often used for illusion magic. Magnetism and matter modification can be used to move and levitate objects, or matter to reshape objects. Replication modification can be used to influence low complexity lifeforms, to cure disease, heal wounds, or somewhat strengthen or weaken a more complex organism (like PC races).</p>
<h2>Combination</h2>
<p>Combination mastery is gained with 3D in Arcane Engineering. This mastery allows casters to create single spells that combine multiple spheres of magic. Light and sound can create a more compelling illusion, working together. Replication and sound can give voice to creatures that normally don't speak. Matter and Magnetism can create arrows or other projectiles that are drawn to their targets. The possibilities are nearly endless.</p>
<h2>Augmenation</h2>
<p>Augmenation mastery is gained with 5D in Arcane Engineering.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Creation mastery is gained with 7D in Arcane Engineering.</p>
<h2>Nullification</h2>
<p>Nullification mastery is gained with 9D in Arcane Engineering.</p>
<h1>Impovised Spells</h1>
<p>Improvised spellcasting involves any spellcasting where the caster has not memorized the mechanics of the spell beforehand. Impovised casting can lead up to the next type of magic, spell-crafting.</p>
