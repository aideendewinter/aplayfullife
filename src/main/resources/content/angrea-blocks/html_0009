<h1>A World of Magic</h1>
<p>Angrea is a world rich in magic. It permeates the plane, and allows for the immortal existance of its Gods. The Gods are embodiments and channels for the plane's magic, but it existed before all but Iliana and Korin, and will most likely exist long after the Neuranian Empire and its Gods have disappeared from history.</p>
<p>A number of rules define how magic is used in Angrea. Whether casters are weaving effects on the spot, or channeling pre-memorized spells, the rules affect how much skill they require, and how many successes they must achieve from their dice pool in order to pull off the reality bending effects that magic allows.</p>
<h1>Spheres of Magic<h1>
<p>There are five spheres of magic. They encompass every connection where magic can interact with Angrea. Before Canaedus it was believed there were only four spheres, but as a mortal he was able to map out and prove the fifth sphere, known as either Life or Replication, depending on how pedantic the speaker is, as well as formulate an elegant proof of why it is the final sphere that will ever be discovered. This hasn't stopped meta-magic theoriticians from occasionally proposing six or more spheres, though such theories rarely gain much traction with practical magic engineers.</p>

<h1>Impovised Spells</h1>
<p>Improvised spellcasting involves any spellcasting where the caster has not memorized the mechanics of the spell before hand. Impovised casting can lead up to the next type of magic, spell-crafting.</p>
