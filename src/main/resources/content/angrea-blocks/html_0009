<h1>A World of Magic</h1>
<p>Angrea is a world rich in magic. It permeates the plane, and allows for the immortal existance of it's Gods. The Gods are embodiments and channels for the plane's magic, but it existed before all but Iliana and Korin, and will most likely exist long after the Neuranian Empire and it's Gods have disappeared from history.</p>
<p>A number of rules define how magic is used in Angrea. Whether casters are weaving effects on the spot, or channeling pre-memorized spells, the rules affect how much skill they require, and how many successes they must achieve from their dice pool in order to pull off the reality bending effects that magic allows.</p>
