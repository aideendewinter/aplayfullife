"I wish I was more like you," said Alan. The steam rising over a mug of instant hot chocolate cupped between his hands. Outside the window, snow was gently falling and blanketing the rarely travelled street that sat a few feet from their apartment door. Alan sat staring out at it, all at once wishing it was Summer and also relishing the feeling of being warm and cozy, curled up in an oversized leather armchair with the smell of melting marshmellows emanating from just below his chin. Steve was facing the other direction, his attention on the two monitors that sat on a desk against the wall opposite the window. He looked quizically at the screen, typing in swift bursts, with long periods of silence in between.
"More like me? Why on earth would you want that?" Steve stopped mid-burst, frowned slightly, held the backspace key down for a moment, then resumed typing.
"You have hobbies, passions. You make things." Alan sipped the hot chocolate, flinching slightly at the still molten heat of the drink. He set it down on the windowsill and cupped his hands over the mug to capture the warmth.
"You make things," Steve countered. He had reached a period of silence, his fingers hanging over the keys, twitching, preparing to start again and stopping, waiting for a fully formed thought to present itself.
"I make shit." Alan paused for a beat, waiting for a sign of protest, a rebuttal. None came. Steve's typing resumed. "I couldn't pay someone to publish one of my articles. I have a blog, a website, and no readers, no one gives a shit what another middle class white cis boy is writing about."
"I like your shit," the rebuttal finally came. "Besides, you sell yourself short. You aren't middle class, you're destitute. There's a buck there if you look for it. People love reading about other people's poverty. It's like rich people's version of 50 Shades, they want to imagine what it's like for the other half."
"You mean the other ninety percent?"
"Don't start that pedantic shit with me. I'll literally out-literal your ass. You know perfectly well that 'the other half' is a well worn figure o' speech." Steve's voice began to lilt towards the end of his sentence, picking up a slight brogue.
"Is that supposed to be an accent?"
"Aye, 'm gettin' 'n da head of me character."
"Is your character a racist sterotype?"
"Fuck you, laddy."
"You wish, you fucking dego. If you're quite done butchering the tongue of my ancestral home, we have snow to shovel."
"Ay, Mic, watch your fucking mouth. Or I'll stuff a potato in it."
"Oh, but I'd like that, wouldn't I?" Alan sipped at the hot chocolate again and, discovering it had cooled to perfect imbibing temerature, proceeeded to drain the mug. "Hey, why does time seem to pass so quickly in Italy?"
"You fucking..." Steve trailed off as he grabbed a magazine off the desk, wheeling around while rolling it up into a makeshift baton. "I'm gonna beat the lucky charms out of you!" He lunged across the back of the couch he had been sitting on, swinging wildly. Alan leaped over the arm of his chair, dashing around the side of the couch, the hallway two steps away. He could have escaped unscathed, but couldn't resist the urge to get one last word in.
"A priest, a pedophile, and an Italian walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?'" Steve hurled the magazine at him, which immediately unrolled, burst open, lost all momentum, and fluttered limply to the couch a foot from his hand. Alan put on a much more practiced and convincing Irish accent, "didja think that'd werk?"
Steve reached for a recently emptied ashtray on the desk. Alan bolted for the hallway, just making it past the threshold as the ashtray slammed into the wall where his head had been a moment before.
