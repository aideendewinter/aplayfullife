Gender is difficult for me to write about. I'm still trying to figure out
exactly what it is, and how it fits into my life. I've never considered myself
masculine in any meaningful way. I really don't know how to follow that sentence.
I've been described as androgynous, I've favored long hair most of my life. I
don't enjoy participating in or even spectating sports, with a few exceptions.
Even the exceptions, though, are not sports generally considered distinctly
masculine. I occasionally enjoy watching fencing, and have toyed with the idea of
learning. Archery. Table tennis. That's about it.

I knew I was different, but I attributed it to being more intelligent, refined,
cerebral. I used to joke about being a lesbian in a man's body. But I never let
myself take it seriously. I converted an old pair of jeans into a skirt, but I
wore pants underneath. Looking back, I can't even clearly remember my motivations.
I knew a kid in detention [The Fire of 1998] that talked about wearing skirts.
It was part of a subculture that e told me called themselves "Freaks", though it
didn't have any connection to the more widely recognized subculture from the 60s
that I'm aware of, and is probably closer to what the mainstream would call Goth.
And while I did play with the idea of embracing the Goth lifestyle at one point,
I don't think I can attribute my desire to attempt wearing a skirt to that alone.

Most would consider me introverted. I've spent a lot of time "in my own head". Yet
now, as I embark on this quest of self-definition, it dawns on me how little of
that time was spent on considering the very place that I spent it. I can talk for
years about activities that I enjoy. But I would be hard pressed to answer any
questions about why I enjoy them. Even harder pressed if asked to describe how they
make me feel. I'm disconnected from my emotions in a way that is completely
different from the bottling up that is commonly attributed to men in this culture.
I don't ignore emotions, rather, I have trouble recognizing them when I have them.
