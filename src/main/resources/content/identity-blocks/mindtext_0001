Now, when I first mentioned dysphoria above, I meant it in the more general, all encompassing sense. In fact, I
have trouble describing my emotions about my gender as dysphoric at all. Though thinking about it now, I know I
struggle with dysphoria, is it so hard to imagine that at least part of that stems from my gender presentation?
How much unease or dissatisfaction does it take to reach "profound"?

I like to think of myself as a creator. I make poetry, stories, games, music. But if I judge myself by my actions,
it's probably more accurate to describe myself as a consumer. I have consumed far more stories, comics, games,
shows, movies, and music than I've ever created. In case you haven't noticed, the cognitive dissonance is strong
in me. That is probably the root of my dysphoria. I believe that I am, or at least could be, a positive force
in the world. Then I eat some ramen, play a video game, and go to bed.

For a long time now I've been letting the dysphoria drive me to indifference. I've maintained my appearance only
at minimum societal standards. I still wear clothes purchased for me in high school. I help friends and family
when they ask, but by and large, I haven't accomplished much of anything. I hope that this site changes that.
I want to build something that will not only help me organize the chaos in my head, but something that will
hopefully inform and inspire others as well. If nothing else, perhaps a psychology grad student can use it as
an interesting case study.
