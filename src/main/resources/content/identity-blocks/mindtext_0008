Games. The most effort any species on earth has ever gone through
just to play. We make up rules, craft props, design dohickies. I
guess humans never have been good at keeping things simple. Is that
a vice or a virtue? The diversity it creates is certainly
interesting. If there is one cycle that seems to repeat over and
over in human history, it seems to be piling up complexity, until
something becomes a complicated mess, followed by a simplification,
chipping away at the corners until something's purest essence is
found.
