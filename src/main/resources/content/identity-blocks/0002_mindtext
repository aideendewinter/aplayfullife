Identity is in the forefront of modern conversation. Terms like 'gender identity' and 'identity politics' abound.
At its core, identity literally encompasses everything that makes you an individual. As such, it's the perfect
banner under which to take on the task at hand. My personal identity is somthing I've struggled with, and honestly
continue to struggle with. There are so many things that hinge not only on how we see ourselves, but upon how
others perceive us as well.

I'm not psychic, but I'd give good odds that if you asked someone to describe me terms like, 'smart', 'bright', 
'quiet', 'shy', and 'creepy' might get thrown around. These are things I've come to identify in myself. I "know"
that I'm smart, that I'm quiet. I sense that others sometimes find my presence unsettling. I'm not exactly sure
why, but I've accepted it. But these are all relatively superficial descriptions. Someone who really knows me
might tell you that I'm a programmer, or game developer. They might mention that I play guitar and sometimes
keyboard, that I dabble in art, that I write poetry.

As I write this, I notice how much these descriptions are bound up in action.
