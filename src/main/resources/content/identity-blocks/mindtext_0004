Abstraction is such an interesting idea. It is itself what it claims to identify. Self-reference
is really the core of self-identity. I could gush about this idea alone for hours, but I don't 
think I could say it any better than Dr. Douglas Hofstadter did in his book "I Am a Strange Loop".
Maybe it has something to do with my aphantasia, but the idea of concepts as their own entities
appeals to me on an extremely deep level.
