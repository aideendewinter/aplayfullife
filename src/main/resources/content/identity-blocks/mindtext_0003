I enjoy learning systems. Is enjoy the right word? 'Excel at' would certainly fit. 'Lose myself in'.
Something about networks, of rules, of people, ideas, abstractions. Abstractions. I really enjoy
abstractions. How they're composed, how they make new concepts visible. I think abstractions might
actually lie at the heart of this little project. We use them to categorize the world, and I think
that maybe I've become a little obsessed with the idea of cataloguing the abstractions in my own head.
Lay down the semantic network of my own mind for all to see.
