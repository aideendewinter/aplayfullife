Now, when I first mentioned dysphoria above, I meant it in the more general, all encompassing sense. In fact, I
have trouble describing my emotions about my gender as dysphoric at all. Though thinking about it now, I know I
struggle with dysphoria, is it so hard to imagine that at least part of that stems from my gender presentation?
How much unease or dissatisfaction does it take to reach "profound"?

I like to think of myself as a creator. I make poetry, stories, games, music. But if I judge myself by my actions,
it's probably more accurate to describe myself as a consumer. I have consumed far more stories, comics, games,
shows, movies, and music than I've ever created.
