Games have been a part of my life for nearly as long as I can remember. I
remember watching my brother play his Nintendo, and occasionally getting
the chance to play myself. Or accidently breaking the Atari with a penny.
Mario Bros., Duck Hunt. I loved duck hunt. At some point I remember getting
a Power Glove. I don't really remember using it to play games, though I remember
using the function that beeps when the glove wasn't pointing at the Nintendo to
make a makeshift door alarm.

I never owned my own console growing up. When I reached high school I began
using the family computer for gaming. I played shareware games, and yes, I
pirated some games as well. I got a laptop, for my birthday, but within less
than a year my younger brother had broken the screen. I hooked it up to a monitor,
but I don't really recall how much gaming I did on it after that. My senior
year I met my friend Clarke. I ended up with his computer.

Clarke used to watch me play single player games, like he was partaking in
an interactive movie.
