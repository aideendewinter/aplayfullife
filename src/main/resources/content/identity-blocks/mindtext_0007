Games have been a part of my life for nearly as long as I can remember. I
remember watching my brother play his Nintendo, and occasionally getting
the chance to play myself. Or accidently breaking the Atari with a penny.
Mario Bros., Duck Hunt. I loved duck hunt. At some point I remember getting
a Power Glove. I don't really remember using it to play games, though I remember
using the function that beeps when the glove wasn't pointing at the Nintendo to
make a makeshift door alarm.

I never owned my own console growing up. When I reached high school I began
using the family computer for gaming. I played shareware games, and yes, I
pirated some games as well. I got a laptop, for my birthday, but within less
than a year my younger brother had broken the screen. I hooked it up to a monitor,
but I don't really recall how much gaming I did on it after that. I loved Quest For
Glory, and still do. I want to do a remake. My senior year I met my friend Clarke.
I ended up with his computer.

Clarke used to watch me play single player games, like he was partaking in an
interactive movie. He enjoyed action games. Max Payne, Devil May Cry. I also
spent a lot of time in Wheel of Time, the first game to license the Unreal engine.
From there I moved to Unreal Tournament, Unreal 2, and eventually Unreal Tournament
2013. From the very beginning I dove into the Unreal Editor and began messing around
with creating levels, and later mods. I was involved briefly with USkaarj, a Total
Conversion mod that attempted to turn Unreal Tournament into an RTS. I later released
a game type for UT2003, to little fanfare, which was probably justified. It's far
enough in the past that I can admit it was pretty much garbage. I had plans for a
more ambitious mod, that unfortunately never got completed. Part of a pattern of
unfinished projects that haunts me still.

Clarke ended up leaving his computer at my house when he left to attempt joining the
military. A few years later the FBI showed up on my doorstep to interview me for his
security clearance. In between I moved to North Carolina and stayed with him in a
house he was subletting with a group of Duke University students. I played a lot of
Jedi Outcast that summer.

Eventually I bought my own PC, an alienware. I used the money from my first paid
web design gig. Many hours were spent on Elder Scrolls. Morrowind, but more so
Oblivion. With the ease of using Elder Scrolls Creation Kit, I began working again
on ideas for mods that would never see the light of day. I had also been programming
in C++ and Java since my senior year. So I began fooling around in 3D engines.
