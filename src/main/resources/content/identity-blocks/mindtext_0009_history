For most of my life I never really considered my own identity.
I existed. Half-heartedly at times. I allowed myself to be defined
mostly by others. I was defined by my heritage, my birth place,
my skin color, my height. Pale German-Irish-British giant from
North Dakota. About the only identity that I claimed for myself
was a reader. It's not a bad identity to have. But when the
driving force is escaping reality, it's not great as the only
quality you can point at to differentiate yourself. Throughout
school, reading was a factor in nearly every choice I made. I
picked out clothes because they had pockets large enough for
paperbacks. When I could, I spent my freetime in libraries.

When I couldn't dive into the stacks of a library, I was usually
reading. When I couldn't read, when I was forced to be outside,
and couldn't find a library, I wandered.
