A core of humans, I propose, is the desire in our lives to have everything classified. Even ourselves. Identity
looms larger and larger, ever more a standard in our daily lexicon. Our conversations holding orbits around it. 
Terms about it work their way into our minds. 'Gender Identity', 'Identity Politics'. New associations accumulate.
Identity encompasses everything that makes you recognizably an individual. It is the accumulation of every little
difference. A tower of everything you are and are not. My own tower is somewhat unstable. Truthfully, I struggle
daily to overcome it's somewhat shaky behaviour. I diagnose no abnormality in myself when I confess that.
Investigate yourself, maybe you'll find a similarly constructed tower. Humans reflect, so that our images really
represent the thoughts of others. So how others perceive us can become very nearly as important as how we see
ourselves. Until eventually...

One day we realize we don't totally own our own identities.

While I'm not psychic, I'd give good odds that if you asked someone to describe me terms like, 'smart', 'bright', 
'quiet', 'shy', and 'creepy' might get thrown around. These are things I've come to identify in myself. I "know"
that I'm smart, that I'm quiet. I sense that others sometimes find my presence unsettling. I'm not exactly sure
why, but I've accepted it. But these are all relatively superficial descriptions. Someone who really knows me
might tell you that I'm a programmer, or game developer. They might mention that I play guitar and sometimes
keyboard, that I dabble in art, that I write poetry.

As I write this, I notice how much these descriptions are bound up in action. I know I'm smart because I test well,
shy because I don't talk. I'm a programmer and game developer because I code games. I guess it goes back to that old
saying that actions speak louder than words. We are what we do. It's important to remember that every once in a while.
It's important to consider how we spend our time. Most people consider themselves to be good. We are all the
protagonists of our own stories. But are you actually doing anything to help others, to make the world a better
place than when you got here?

Personally, I struggle with that question often. So far, my life has been pretty selfish, by my own estimations. I
help people here and there. Fixing their computer or teaching them something. But I constantly feel like I could be
doing so much more. There is a dissonance between my internal identity and what I know my actions represent. I struggle
with dysphoria on an almost daily basis. Dysphoria. Funny, four paragraphs and I have yet to mention the more recently
discovered, and many would say one of the larger facets of my identity. The fact that I am a transgender woman.
