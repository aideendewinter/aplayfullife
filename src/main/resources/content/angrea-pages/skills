<p>Skills determine the outcome of almost every action your character takes in Angrea. Chopping wood? Thatâ€™s a skill check. Cooking dinner? Skill check. Flirting with an attractive innkeeper? Skill check. Whenever you try to do a task where there is a chance of failure, the GM will determine what skill applies, and what attributes are available to use with it. Picking a lock? That will usually be Mechanical Engineering + Agility. Haggling with a merchant? Now things get interesting.</p>
