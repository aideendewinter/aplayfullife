<h1>A Playful Life</h1>
<p>
  Hi there. A Playful Life is a site dedicated to my explorations of play and meaning. Inside you will find
  a number of experiments in play and design. You will find some philosophy, some rants, and a few games. I
  hope you enjoy the site as much as I enjoyed making it.<br />
  Love,<br />
  Jess T. Whitworth
